About IRSA: 

IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) simplifies permission management in EKS by allowing each Kubernetes service account to have a dedicated IAM role. This provides Pods with precise AWS permissions, removing the need for shared credentials or overly permissive EC2 instance roles.


# Implementation
